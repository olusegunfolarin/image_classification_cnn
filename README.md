# image_classification_cnn
This project seeks to develop a neural netwwork model that us able to distinguish cats and dogs image. It makes use of the keras Image data generator module that flows image from directory.

The model achieves an accuracy of 90% on the validation set.
The single_predictor.py script is for single instance prediction, however the instance has been coded in the script contained in the datsets folder. This script can be modified for other prediction test.
